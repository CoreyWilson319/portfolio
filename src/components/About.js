      <p>
        I am a graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineer Immersive
        program. After going some time of trying to self-teach myself to become
        a developer, and losing my job due to covid-19 opened the door for me to
        take the time to participate in this program. During this program I
        improved my understanding of the basics of coding as well as taking that
        knowledge further and developing full stack web applications. I believe
        that I am ready to take the leap to the next step and become a
        professional software engineer. I am soft spoken and reserved which
        allow me to work well with a team and individually. I am a good problem
        solver and am always trying to think ahead and possible outcomes.
