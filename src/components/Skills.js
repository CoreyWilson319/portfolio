        I'm familiar with using linux and windows operating systems linux being
        what I use the most as of now. I'm proficient in both python and
        javascript. I've used both MERN and PERN stacks for projects however I'm
        more familiar with MERN. At the moment I'm learning AWS and trying to
        find time to begin learning Java. I regularly use node.js, reactjs, git,
        and fullstack development and have used Heroku, Netlify and Github
        Pages. If you've tried looking at my projects and it's taking a while to
        load you can try refreshing Heroku can be incredibly slow at times.
